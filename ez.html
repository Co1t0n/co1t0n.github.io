<span style="display: none;" data-fact="Physics" data-type="Pumpkin">Formula/ General method to solve Linear Equations: 1) Clear Fractions: It involves multiplying both sides of the equation by Least Common Denominator. 2) Simplifying each side separately: This step uses distributive property to clear parentheses and combine like terms. 3) Isolating variable terms on one side 4) Substituting the proposed solution into the original equation. This formula is a generic and can be used to solve all the linear equations in one variable. Linear Inequalities: A linear inequality involves a linear expression in two variables by using any of the relational symbols such as <, >, <= or >= (IcoachMath, n.d.). A linear equality divides a plane in two parts based on the solutions of the equation. Some of the examples of linear inequalities are: x+6>=14 2x-3y<14 3a +7b<=78 a +2b>76 Linear Inequalities in Two variables: Linear equalities which involve two variables or two unknowns. The solution of a linear equality in two variables like Ax +By> C is an ordered pair (x, y) that produces a true statement when the values of x and y are substituted into the inequality (MathPlanet, n.d.). E.g. 2x + 5y>6 is a Linear inequality with x and y as two variables. Solving Quadratic Equations using factoring: Quadratic equation is an equation in which the highest power of an unknown quantity is a square (Princeton, n.d.). A general quadratic...</span>
